## The Project

This project was created as a deliverable for the course POPF P8633 - Issues in School-Based Health at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

<br>

**POPF P8633 - Issues in School Based Health** <br>

"Issues in School Based Health is a course designed to give students the opportunity to engage with
<br>schools so that they have experience and they can learn how to apply both theory and practice. A
principle of school health is breaking down silos between health and education. Our goal is to provide
participants with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with NYC public schools. They
must complete a project designed to inform the school health-related work at NYC schools in groups.
Every year students focus on a topic impacting schools. This yearâ€™s focus will be staff and teacher mental
health support and burnout prevention."

**Final Project Description: Supporting Teacher Well-Being and Mental Health** <br>

Educators are leaving the field at alarming rates due to burnout and stress. There are additional stressors for teachers of color and COVID and the racial events of 2020 have further compounded teacher stress and trauma. Educator attrition has a negative impact on student learning and the bottom line for schools and school districts. Schools cannot address learning loss if they do not prioritize teacher healing now. As MPH students in this class, we worked in a group to develop a project that supports the needs of the schools related to teacher mental health and well-being.

Specifically, our team:

* Delivered a needs and assets assessment to the school staff (conversational interview)
* Compiled results and worked with schools to come up with a project that would support the need of
the schools
* Created an agreed upon deliverable that addresses the problem and present it in a way that
makes sense for teachers and school administrators
